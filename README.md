## Introduction
In this project, I find open source data to conduct my own analyzation to form a effective and informational presentation.

## Key Questions and Objectives.
To create a dashboard that is representative of the analytical journey that curates the key results discovered through the project. 


# Project Deliverables and Final Analysis Critera.

```
● Exploratory Analysis through Visualizations (Scatterplots, Correlation Heatmaps, Pair Plots, and Categorical plots.)
● Geospatial Analysis using a shapefile (GeoJson).
● Regression Analysis.
● Cluster Analysis.
● Time-series Analysis.
● Analysis narrative and final results.
● Functional and presentable storyboard/dashboard.
```

# Data Requirements.
The data that was chosen to conduct the project must have met these criteria:
```
 ● Be open source;
 ● Come from an authentic/authoritative source;
 ● Include non-anonymized column names;
 ● Be no more than 3 years old(up to a maximum of 10 years if you’ve found a perfect data set for your needs and no newer data is available);
 ● Contain at least 2 continuous variables (excluding index or ID variables, dates, years, etc.);
 ● Contain at least 2 categorical variables (excluding index or ID variables, dates, years, etc.);
 ● Contain at least 1,500 rows;

```
